/*
 * The silent renewal of the session (useOidc.silentRenew) has three outcomes: the renewed user, `null` (the session is
 * over: Zitadel refused the refresh token, or there is nothing to renew with: the staff member must sign in again), and
 * this error: the renewal could not be attempted or finished (no network, a timeout, Zitadel down). The session is
 * untouched: the refresh token may well still be valid, so the callers keep the staff member signed in, do not send them
 * to the login page, and the next request tries again.
 *
 * It is recognised by name, not `instanceof`: the callers load useOidc with a dynamic import, and a module that is
 * evaluated twice (a reset in a test, a duplicated chunk) would give two classes.
